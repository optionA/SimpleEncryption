# EncrytionApplication
Apps Group 8 Project: EncrytionApplication

Its not exactly pretty but at least it works.
Includes 4 Windows (HomeMenu, Encryption, Decryption, and KeyChage) all of which are very limited, but have some additional silly UI elements added as a proof of concept.
Still missing custom error messages for mismatched keys and unreachable or missing files.
